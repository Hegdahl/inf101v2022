With maven installed, it should work to run {\ttfamily ./build.sh}.

This will build the project itself in addition to every game in the folder {\ttfamily /src/games}.

The main executable will be called {\ttfamily inf101v2022.\+out}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Windows}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
With maven installed, run {\ttfamily mvn package}.

This will build an executable .jar file which is the host and join program, and also functions as the library when building a game.

The path for the jar file will be {\ttfamily target\textbackslash{}inf101v2022-\/\{version\}-\/\+SNAPSHOT-\/jar-\/with-\/dependencies.\+jar}. I suggest making a copy with a shorter name in the base of the directory.

To build a game, run 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{javac path\(\backslash\)to\(\backslash\)the\(\backslash\)game.java -\/d where\(\backslash\)to\(\backslash\)put\(\backslash\)the\(\backslash\)game -\/cp the\_jar\_file.jar}

\end{DoxyCode}


The jar can not be ran directly in the terminal, but is instead ran like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{java -\/jar the\_jar\_file.jar args}

\end{DoxyCode}


where args are arguemnts as described in the {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} outputs at the start of this document.
